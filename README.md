# Starbucks-Offers
This is the Capstone project I submitted in order to complete my Data Science Nanodegree at Udacity platform (https://www.udacity.com/).
## Installation
The code uses Jupyter Notebook and the libraries which are already installed in it. However, I had to update my pandas version by running 'conda update pandas' in the terminal so that pandas can read the json input files.
## Motivation
As part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Capstone Project, Starbucks has offered simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. I use demographic, transaction and offer data in order split people in different demographic groups and predict the following for each group:

1. Conversion rate for each of the 10 different offer types
2. View rate of overall offer types
3. Non-offer related spending

The files I used for this project were provided by Udacity platform as json inputs.

## File description
There is one Jupyter Notebook here named Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb. This file includes the full Python code I used for this project along with informative comments.

## Results

The findings of this investigation have been posted in Medium. Please see link here:

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
As mentioned above this is simulated data provided by Starbucks (no Personal data of customers is present here).
You can find reference of the resources I used at the end of the Medium article above.
