# Starbucks-Offers
This is the Capstone project I submitted in order to complete my Data Science Nanodegree at Udacity platform (https://www.udacity.com/).
## Installation
The code uses Jupyter Notebook and the libraries which are already installed in it. However, I had to update my pandas version by running 'conda update pandas' in the terminal so that pandas can read the json input files.
## Motivation
As part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Capstone Project, Starbucks has offered simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. I use demographic, transaction and offer data in order split people in different demographic groups and predict the following for each group:

1. Conversion rate for each of the 10 different offer types
2. View rate of overall offer types
3. Non-offer related spending

The files I used for this project were provided by Udacity platform as json inputs.

## File description
There is one Jupyter Notebook here named Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb. This file includes the full Python code I used for this project along with informative comments.

## Results

The findings of this investigation have been posted in Medium. Please see link here:
(https://medium.com/@georgios.kokkinopoulos/starbucks-offers-conversion-rate-demographics-4df4bf1cbae1)

You can find a summary of the results here as well:
* Demographic data about customers (profile dataset) was cleaned
* Transcript data was enhanced in order to include converted offers, view rate and non-offer related spending by person
* Some inference about overall CR, VR and non-offer spending revealed significant differences between potential categories so the decision was made to split age and income in 3 equal categories. That created 18 categories in total.
* Transcript dataset was further enhanced to include categories.
* Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor and Support Vector Regressor were trained and fitted to the data and RFR was proved to be the best estimator.
* A heatmap at the end (predicted target variables by category) provided very useful insight as to what offers should be sent to what categories.

As mentioned above this is simulated data provided by Starbucks (no personal data of customers is present here).
